AB  - Pumped hydro storage is analogous to the operation of a massive battery, capable of storing hundreds of megawatts of energy in a simple and sustainable manner. Hydrogeneration projects are strategic in nature and always involve an investment on a national scale. Hydroelectric power is the gift of nature for countries that have water resources (rivers or lakes) and also the topography that supports such projects.

AB  - Robust Optimization (RO) is a modeling methodology, combined with computational tools, to process optimization problems in which the data are uncertain and is only known to belong to some uncertainty set. The paper surveys the main results of RO as applied to uncertain linear, conic quadratic and semidefinite programming. For these cases, computationally tractable robust counterparts of uncertain problems are explicitly obtained, or good approximations of these counterparts are proposed, making RO a useful tool for real-world applications. We discuss some of these applications, specifically: antenna design, truss topology design and stability analysis/synthesis in uncertain dynamic systems. We also describe a case study of 90 LPs from the NETLIB collection. The study reveals that the feasibility properties of the usual solutions of real world LPs can be severely affected by small perturbations of the data and that the RO methodology can be successfully used to overcome this phenomenon.

AB  - Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Annie Hwang, statistical assistant, and the world production tables were prepared by Glenn J. Wallace, international data coordinator. In 2015, the United States remained the fourth-ranked mine producer of copper behind chile, china, and peru, and accounted for about 7% of global production (table 20). U.S. mine production of recoverable copper increased to 1.38 million metric tons (Mt), slightly greater than that of 2014, and the highest since 2000, when production was 1.45 Mt. The principal mining States for copper, in descending order of production, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana, and Michigan, accounted for more than 99% of domestic production; copper was also recovered at mines in Idaho and Missouri. Although copper was recovered at 26 mines in the United States during 2015, 18 mines accounted for more than 99% of production (table 2). The remaining mines were either small leach operations or byproduct producers of copper. Global mine production increased by 4% to 19.1 Mt. chile's mined copper production was essentially unchanged and it remained the leading world producer. It accounted for 30% of global production and produced about 4 Mt more than the second-ranked producer, china, which accounted for 9% of global production. peru was the third-ranked producer and accounted for 9% of global production. The remaining countries among the 10 leading producers were, in descending order of production, the United States, congo (Kinshasa), Australia, russia, Zambia, canada, and Mexico. Fifty-two countries were known to have mined copper in 2015. The 10 leading producers accounted for 80% of production, and the 20 leading producers accounted for 95% of production (table 20). Global smelter production increased by 4% in 2015 and refinery production rose slightly owing to across-the-board increases in primary electrolytic and electrowon and secondary refinery production. The United States ranked ninth in copper smelter production and accounted for 3% of world production (table 21). The United States accounted for 5% of world refined copper production and remained the fourth-leading producer behind china (35%), chile (12%), and Japan (6%) (table 22). In 2015, copper recovered from refined or remelted scrap in the United States totaled 805,000 metric tons (t) (about 79% from new scrap and 21% from old scrap) and accounted for 33% of the total U.S. copper supply. The conversion of new and old scrap to alloys and refined copper decreased by 5% and 4%, respectively (tables 1, 6). In addition to scrap consumed domestically, an additional 955,000 t of scrap (gross weight) was exported, the majority of which was thought to be old scrap (table 18). copper scrap exports reached a record high of 1.2 Mt in 2011, which corresponded with the record-high annual average price for copper. Copper was consumed as refined copper and as direct melt scrap at about 30 brass mills; 13 wire-rod mills; and 500 chemical plants, foundries, and miscellaneous operations. According to data compiled by the International copper Study Group (IcSG) (2016a, p. 9, 19–20), global consumption of refined copper was essentially unchanged from that of 2014 at 23.0 Mt owing to lower growth in china relative to the previous year. In 2015, apparent consumption in china increased by 3% to about 11.4 Mt, accounting for 49% of global consumption, compared with an increase of 14% during 2014. The IcSG calculation of china's apparent consumption was based on reported production, trade, and Shanghai Futures exchange (SHFe) stock data and did not include unreported Government or industry stocks, which can fluctuate significantly on an annual basis. consumption in the United States increased by 3% and accounted for 8% of total global consumption. on a regional basis, consumption in 2015 increased slightly in Asia (and remained unchanged if china is excluded), by 3% in North America, and slightly in the european Union. consumption in Asia accounted for 66% of global consumption (17% excluding china), the europe n Union accounted for 14% of consumption, and North America accounted for 10%. From 2005 to 2015, global consumption of refined copper increased by 38%, a compound annual growth rate of about 3% per year, with slight decreases in 2005 and 2008. over the same time period, apparent refined copper consumption in China more than tripled, with a compound annual growth rate of about 12% per year. According to the ICSG, global consumption of refined copper exceeded production by 153,000 t in 2015. This was the sixth consecutive year that global consumption of refined copper was greater than global production. Despite the apparent production shortfall, reported global yearend inventories of refined copper increased by 13% to 1.52 Mt, about 7% of annual consumption of refined copper (International Copper Study Group, 2015, p. 25; 2016a, p. 9, 19–21). In 2015, the average annual commodity exchange, Inc. (coMeX) spot price declined by about 20% to $2.51 per pound of copper. The average annual copper price reached a record-high $4.00 per pound in 2011 but has declined in each of the following years (table 1).

AB  - Recycling is a key strategy to reduce the environmental impact associated with industrial resource use. Recent improvements in materials recovery technologies offer the possibility for recouping additional value from recycling. However, incorporation of secondary raw materials into production may be constrained by operational complexity in two-stage blending processes. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution to demonstrate the importance of integrated planning (IP) approaches for two-stage blending operations in recycling. Our results suggest that the quality of materials obtained from the first stage strongly influences performance in the second stage. Current disjointed planning (DP) approaches in the recycling industry, where individual stages are independently planned without decision-making about intermediate blend design, overlook this interaction and, therefore, make conservative use of lower quality materials. We develop an IP model using a formulation of the pooling problem and apply it to an industrial-scale aluminum recycling facility located in Europe. The results suggest that the IP model can reduce material costs by more than 5%, for the case examined, and can enable increased use of undervalued raw materials. This study also investigates the impact of variations in operational conditions on the benefits of IP.

He received his PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Illinois, performed postdoctoral work at U.C. Berkeley, and was a Lawrence Fellow at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Dr. Grossman's group uses a combination of modeling and experiment to gain fundamental understanding, develop new insights based on this understanding, then use these insights to develop new materials with improved properties for energy conversion, energy storage, and membrane-based separation technologies. There exists a gap between applied academic research and commercial viability illustrated here through a case study in membrane technologies. Despite hundreds of new proposals for materials, commercially available membranes for water filtration and other applications have largely remained unchanged. Yet the potential benefits of new membrane materials are enormous. With more emphasis on customer discovery and technoeconomic analysis, the impact of research can be immensely powerful, driving scientific progress to solve global challenges such as energy utilization.

AB  - The challenges brought on by the increasing complexity of electronic products, and the criticality of the materials these devices contain, present an opportunity for maximizing the economic and societal benefits derived from recovery and recycling. Small appliances and computer devices (SACD), including mobile phones, contain significant amounts of precious metals including gold and platinum, the present value of which should serve as a key economic driver for many recycling decisions. However, a detailed analysis is required to estimate the economic value that is unrealized by incomplete recovery of these and other materials, and to ascertain how such value could be reinvested to improve recovery processes. We present a dynamic product flow analysis for SACD throughout Portugal, a European Union member, including annual data detailing product sales and industrial-scale preprocessing data for recovery of specific materials from devices. We employ preprocessing facility and metals pricing data to identify losses, and develop an economic framework around the value of recycling including uncertainty. We show that significant economic losses occur during preprocessing (over $70 M USD unrecovered in computers and mobile phones, 2006-2014) due to operations that fail to target high value materials, and characterize preprocessing operations according to material recovery and total costs.

AB  - © 2018, Yale University. Many advanced energy and environmentally relevant technologies rely on metals that have been identified as critical, or whose availability may be limited. Several of these elements are produced mostly as by-products of mining other base metals (carriers). This by-product dependence has been proposed as a significant supply-risk indicator by the materials criticality community. This article provides new quantitative evidence that, in several cases, by-product metals' availability may not be directly limited by carrier supply. We perform an assessment based on characteristics essential to by-product metals, including physical concentration, market value of metals, and extraction technology efficiency. We analyze 40 carrier/by-product pairs and identify five 'high-by-product' pairs. We assess the supply responsiveness of these metals. Our analysis suggests that rather than limited primary production of carrier, lack of incentive for improving recovery efficiency may limit availability of the by-product. This behavior is found in the zinc-indium and copper-selenium systems. For germanium, on the other hand, we instead propose influence from the by-product market itself leading to price inelasticity of supply. As a complement to other quantitative methods developed for material systems, such as material flow analysis, we provide an essential technoeconomic analysis of the by-product metals problem by employing cluster analysis and econometric modeling. This approach provides insight into supply-risk mitigation strategies related to extraction efficiency and supply-chain structure.

AB  - Increased interest in high entropy alloys (HEA)s has led to significant activity in the development of new equimolar multicomponent metal systems. The present viewpoint article suggests applying a lens of practicality related to alloy economics and resource usage issues. A framework for HEA materials selection is presented to assist the metallurgical community as it searches for HEAs with feasible implementation possibilities, by identifying unsuitable alloying elements based on price or metrics of supply availability. For some metrics, such as price volatility, the elemental diversification in HEAs could prove beneficial, while for others, such as recyclability, elemental breadth introduces significant challenges.

AB  - The supply of recycled material depends on historic consumption, i.e. what constitutes scrap available today originates from previously made products. Analytical tools, such as materials flow analysis, use this observation to estimate scrap metal flows. The supply of recycled metal also depends on changing economic conditions, e.g. metal consumption rates correlate with changes in gross domestic product. We use an autoregressive distributed lag approach to model the supply of recycled copper as a complementary approach to material flow analysis. We find that both industrial activity and world GDP correlate with total scrap supply, with limited dependence on copper price. We also develop independent models for direct remelt (higher quality) and refined (lower quality) scrap. A 1% increase in industrial production leads to a 2.1% increase in higher quality scrap quantity, while a similar increase in world GDP leads to a 1.4% increase in lower quality scrap. Based on this model dependence, we suggest that a recycling policy aimed at increasing recycling through the use of subsidies, taxes or price incentives should be directed towards the low-end segment of the scrap market and there it may still only have limited impact.

AB  - This chapter presents the current status of large-size stationary solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems and provides guidelines based on initial European experience in this sector. The authors refer to non-residential systems, usually in the range of tens of kW to MW size. Both commercial buildings and industrial applications are found within this sector. Even if Asia is the most active area for stationary SOFCs (due to widespread residential SOFC projects), the analysis on large SOFC stationary plants picks out the USA as the homeland of the market, with a large number of completed installations from Bloom Energy in the last 7 years, especially in California, thanks to the “fuel cells” dedicated program (State of California Self-Generation Incentive Program, SGIP). California has now more than 200 MW of fuel cell-based systems and world-renowned companies like Apple, eBay, IKEA, and Coca-Cola have installed the Bloom Energy SOFC system. Pacific Asia is also trying to enlarge the market by pushing research on pressurized hybrid plants (LG Fuel Cell Systems and Mitsubishi-Hitachi Heavy Industries): recent installations and projects confirm the interest in this technology. The chapter’s first section shows the current status of large-size stationary SOFC companies and installations across the world, based on the most recent declarations and news from the industry. In Europe, the first industrial size biogas-fed SOFC system was installed in 2017 within the framework of the DEMOSOFC project. The chapter provides a complete description of the plant layout, including the biogas purification system, the 58 kWe SOFC module, the heat recovery section, and the electrical layout. Preliminary results from the first thousand hours of operation are presented in terms of purification outcomes, SOFC efficiency and emissions and island mode operation. The chapter ends with a summary of criticalities, strengths, and guidelines for the large-size SOFC systems market.

AB  - Operational uncertainties create disincentives for use of recycled materials in metal alloy production. One that greatly influences remelter batch optimization is variation in the raw material composition, particularly for secondary materials. Currently, to accommodate compositional variation, firms commonly set production targets well inside the window of compositional specification required for performance reasons. Window narrowing, while effective, does not make use of statistical sampling data, leading to sub-optimal usage of recycled materials. This paper explores the use of a chance-constrained optimization method, which allows explicit consideration of statistical information on composition. The framework and a case study of cast and wrought production with available scrap materials are presented. Results show that it is possible to increase the use of recycled material without compromising the likelihood of batch errors, when using this method compared to conventional window narrowing. This benefit of the chance-constrained method grows with increase in compositional uncertainty and is driven by scrap portfolio diversification. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As design for recycling becomes more broadly applied in material and product design, analytical tools to quantify the environmental implications of design choices will become a necessity. Currently, few systematic methods exist to measure and direct the metallurgical alloy design process to create alloys that are most able to be produced from scrap. This is due, in part, to the difficulty in evaluating such a context-dependent property as recyclability of an alloy, which will depend on the types of scraps available to producers, the compositional characteristics of those scraps, their yield, and the alloy specification itself. This article explores the use of a chance-constrained based optimization model, similar to models used in operational planning in secondary production today, to (1) characterize the challenge of developing recycling-friendly alloys due to the contextual sensitivity of recycling, (2) demonstrate how such models can be used to evaluate the potential scrap usage of alloys, and (3) explore the value of sensitivity analysis information to proactively identify effective alloy modifications that can drive increased potential scrap use. These objectives are demonstrated through two cases that involve the production of a broad range of alloys utilizing representative scraps from three classes of industrial end uses.

AB  - Increasing recycling will be a key strategy for moving toward sustainable materials usage. There are many barriers to increasing recycling, including quality issues in the scrap stream. Repeated recycling can compound this problem through the accumulation of tramp elements over time. This paper explores the importance of capturing recycler decision-making in accurately modeling accumulation and the value of technologies intended to mitigate it. A method was developed combining dynamic material flow analysis with allocation of those materials into production portfolios using blending models. Using this methodology, three scrap allocation methods were explored in the context of a case study of aluminum use: scrap pooling, pseudoclosed loop, and market-based. Results from this case analysis suggest that market-driven decisions and upgrading technologies can partially mitigate the negative impact of accumulation on scrap utilization, thereby increasing scrap use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A market-based allocation method for modeling material flows suggests a higher value for upgrading strategies compared to a pseudoclosed loop or pooling allocation method for the scenarios explored.

AB  - Recyclability is a context dependent materials property that has proven challenging to evaluate. However, previous studies by the authors have shown that certain modeling techniques, specifically chance constrained optimization, can provide a quantitative evaluation of recyclability. This information can be used to accelerate the evaluation and design of alloys (as well as products and operations) for improved recycling. One assumption in this work, however, is that the compositional variability of materials would be normally distributed. Previous work would indicate this may not be the case for all recycled materials. Performance, in terms of recyclability, may then be heavily influenced by the structure of the compositional data used. To test this, specific case studies involving recycled material streams were investigated. Results indicate that the underlying structure/distribution of the compositional data can have a profound effect on alloy design decisions to encourage usage of recycled materials.

AB  - The ecological processes underpinning commodity production have been largely overlooked by theories of social regulation and governance. Conventional applications of regulation theory, for example, often reduce the complex interactions between the environment and processes of accumulation to an homogenous surface on which the institutions of social regulation are inscribed. By contrast, this paper illustrates how the metabolism of production - the flows of raw materials, energy, and wastes central to the production of commodities from the natural environment - can provoke its own set of contradictions for particular industrial sectors. These contradictions can emerge to challenge accumulation in specific industrial sectors when existing practices and institutions fail to ensure continued access to resources and/or to effectively regulate the impacts of production on the environment. This paper describes how historical patterns of using nature in one primary commodity sector - copper mining and processing - contributed to declining profitability in this industry during the early 1980s. The process of copper production is analyzed to identify a series of underlying 'ecological contradictions' that have the potential to impact profitability. The expression of these contradictions is then examined in the specific context of the US Southwest during the 1980s, with particular attention paid to conflicts over the environmental impacts of mining and the accessibility of land to mining firms. The emergence of social conflict over land access and the environment is interpreted in terms of the historical specificity - and obsolescence - of the framework of institutions, legislation and customary relations between corporations, the state and activist groups that had formerly contained and regulated these contradictions.

AB  - There is widespread consensus that landfill of waste electronic and electric equipment is not an acceptable end-of-use management option. Diversion from landfill, either through voluntary or mandatory take-back and collection programs, overwhelmingly leads to the recycling of e-waste, which typically consists of the recovery of a limited number of metals. Cell phones are currently one of the few electronic products, if not the only one, that also have a thriving reuse market. In fact, more handsets are reused than recycled. Cell phones therefore offer the rare opportunity to compare closed-loop supply chains for e-waste reuse and recycling. In this paper, we examine the economics of cell phone reuse and recycling based on detailed primary data collected from reverse logistics, reuse and recycling operations in 2003 in the UK and in 2006 in the US. We show that while cell phone reuse has a healthy profit margin, handset recycling is currently a by-product of reuse. © The Author(s) 2009.

AB  - In order to evaluate the influence of canopy cover and leaf area on the water use of short rotation coppices (SRC), we measured evapotranspiration and transpiration of a young and a full-grown mature poplar SRC throughout one growing season, using the Bowen-ratio energy balance method and sap flux technique, respectively. The young SRC at Fuhrberg had a sparse though developing canopy reaching a maximum leaf area index (LAI) of 3.8m2m-2 in August, while the mature SRC at Gro??fahner earlier reached maximum LAI at 7.4m2m-2. Despite contrasting canopy densities, growing season total evapotranspiration (Fuhrberg: 380mm, Gro??fahner: 445mm) and transpiration ratios did not differ substantially, because understorey transpiration and soil evaporation probably compensated low tree transpiration in the first half of the growing season at LAI<3m2m-2. Mid-season mean daily transpiration on rainless days was 2.34??0.13mmd-1 at Fuhrberg and 3.16??0.81 at Gro??fahner. The values for the full-grown SRC at Gro??fahner were in the middle range of reported values for poplar SRCs of comparable LAI and canopy density, and came from efficient stomatal regulation of transpiration, in which poplar clones might differ. Bulk canopy conductance (gc), calculated by inverting the Penman-Monteith equation and related to vapor pressure deficit (D), revealed stomatal control of transpiration at the mature plantation, and according to a simple hydraulic model, was sufficient to maintain a minimum leaf water potential at high atmospheric demand. This indicated isohydric behavior and marks a conservative water use strategy, which avoids water stress by limiting transpiration rates at high D and might be typical for the investigated poplar hybrid (J-105). The young plantation exhibited a similar water use strategy, when LAI was above 3m2m-2. Before canopy closure, the ratio of stomatal sensitivity (m) and reference conductance (gcref, i.e. gc at D=1kPa), which are parameters of a logarithmical response curve of gc to D, was significantly lower than the theoretical ratio for isohydric responses. This indicates poor stomatal control of water loss and reflected the contribution of understorey-transpiration and soil evaporation to total stand evapotranspiration, which might increase severely at high evaporative demand in sparse poplar stands. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recycling of material resources lies at the heart of the industrial ecology (IE) metaphor. The very notion of the industrial ecosystem is motivated by the idea that we should learn from natural ecosystems how to &#8220;close the loop.&#8221; Recycling is not just central to IE, it is part of everyday life. Unfortunately, how the IE community and the public at large think about recycling includes several misconceptions that have the potential to misguide environmental assessments, policies, and actions that deal with recycling and thus undermine its environmental potential. One misconception stems from na&#239;ve assumptions regarding recycled material displacing primary production. Two others assert the environmental advantages of recycling material multiple times, or at least in a closed loop. A final misconception is the assumption that the distinction between closed and open recycling loops is generally useful. This article explains why these misconceptions are flawed, discusses the implications, and presents an alternative set of principles to better harness the potential environmental benefits of closing material loops.

AB  - Energy "powers" our life, and energy consumption correlates strongly with our standards of living. The developed world has become accustomed to cheap and plentiful supplies. Recently, more of the developing world populations are striving for the same, and taking steps towards securing their future energy needs. Competition over limited supplies of conventional fossil fuel resources is intensifying, and more challenging environmental problems are springing up, especially related to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. There is strong evidence that atmospheric CO2 concentration is well correlated with the average global temperature. Moreover, model predictions indicate that the century-old observed trend of rising temperatures could accelerate as carbon dioxide concentration continues to rise. Given the potential danger of such a scenario, it is suggested that steps be taken to curb energy-related CO2 emissions through a number of technological solutions, which are to be implemented in a timely fashion. These solutions include a substantial improvement in energy conversion and utilization efficiencies, carbon capture and sequestration, and expanding the use of nuclear energy and renewable sources. Some of these technologies already exist, but are not deployed at sufficiently large scale. Others are under development, and some are at or near the conceptual state. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present a dynamic model of global copper stocks and flows which allows a detailed analysis of recycling efficiencies, copper stocks in use, and dissipated and landfilled copper. The model is based on historical mining and refined copper production data (1910-2010) enhanced by a unique data set of recent global semifinished goods production and copper end-use sectors provided by the copper industry. To enable the consistency of the simulated copper life cycle in terms of a closed mass balance, particularly the matching of recycled metal flows to reported historical annual production data, a method was developed to estimate the yearly global collection rates of end-of-life (postconsumer) scrap. Based on this method, we provide estimates of 8 different recycling indicators over time. The main indicator for the efficiency of global copper recycling from end-of-life (EoL) scrap--the EoL recycling rate--was estimated to be 45% on average, ± 5% (one standard deviation) due to uncertainty and variability over time in the period 2000-2010. As uncertainties of specific input data--mainly concerning assumptions on end-use lifetimes and their distribution--are high, a sensitivity analysis with regard to the effect of uncertainties in the input data on the calculated recycling indicators was performed. The sensitivity analysis included a stochastic (Monte Carlo) uncertainty evaluation with 10(5) simulation runs.

AB  - What should we make of the return to the sacred evidenced by the new vitality of churches, sects, and religious beliefs in many parts of the world today? What are the boundaries between the essential traits of religion and those of ethics and justice? Is there a "truth" to religion? This remarkable volume includes reflections on such questions by three of the most important philosophers of our time—Jacques Derrida, Gianni Vattimo, and Hans-Georg Gadamer. Together with other distinguished thinkers, they address a wide range of questions about the meaning, status, and future prospects of religion. In his meditation on the "return of religion," entitled "Faith and Knowledge: The Two Sources of 'Religion' at the Limits of Mere Reason," Derrida addresses the ways in which this return is intrinsically linked to transformations of which the new media are both the carriers and the symptom. Derrida coins this process one of globalatinization. This neologism signals, among other things, the process of a certain universalization of the Roman word or concept of religion, which tends to become hegemonic, as well as a certain performativity discernible in the new media and in contemporary structures of testimony and confession. Examples of this include, Derrida reminds us, not only the phenomenon of televangelism and televisual stagings of the pope's journeys, and not only the portrayal and self-presentation of Islam, but also the fetishization and becoming virtually absolute of the televisual and the multimedial as such. Using Being and Time as a point of reference, Vattimo suggests that religious experience is both an individual experience and a manifestation of a historical rhythm within which religion regularly appears and disappears. A commentary by Gadamer summarizes and enriches the contributions by Derrida and Vattimo. Four essays by Maurizio Ferraris, Eugenio Trias, Vincenzo Vitiello, and Aldo Giorgio Gargani complete the volume by examining other facets of the "religious."

AB  - Wide deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) would greatly facilitate global de-carbonization, but achieving the emission targets depends on future battery prices. Conventional learning curves for manufacturing costs, used in many battery projections, unrealistically predict battery prices will fall below $100/kWh by 2030, pushing EVs to hit price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in the absence of incentives. However, in reality, essential materials costs set practical lower bounds on battery prices. Our 2-stage learning curve model projects the active material costs and NMC-based Lithium-ion battery pack price with mineral and material costs as the respective price floors. The improved model predicts nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery prices will fall only to about $124/kWh by 2030 – much cheaper than today, but still too expensive to truly compete with ICEVs, due primarily to the high prices of cobalt, nickel, and lithium. Our results suggest that stabilizing raw materials prices and/or stimulating R&D activities on alternative battery chemistries will be important to achieve environmentally sustainable EV-based ground transportation at an attractive price.

AB  - Kevin Huang is a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He studies methods for assessing and enhancing the manufacturing scalability of laboratory-derived clean energy technologies. He has a PhD from MIT, an MS from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and a BS from Cornell University, all in materials science and engineering. Liang Li is a graduate student in the Technology and Policy Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her current research is focused on the manufacturing scalability of materials for clean energy applications. She holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the National University of Singapore. Elsa Olivetti is the Atlantic Richfield Associate Professor of Energy Studies in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her research focuses on improving the environmental and economic sustainability of materials using methods informed by materials economics, machine learning, experimental inquiry, and techno-economic analysis. Dr. Olivetti received her BS degree in engineering science from the University of Virginia. Her PhD in materials science and engineering from MIT focused on the development of cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. To fully realize the potential of innovative new clean energy technologies, they must first be produced at large scale and low cost. The scalability of such technologies, however, is driven by the constraints of their large-scale manufacturing processes. By considering how the materials properties, process infrastructure, and production cost of their technologies scale, researchers may be able to design clean energy technologies that are not only high performing but also highly scalable and manufacturable.

AB  - Li-ion batteries have reached an inflection point. In the course of the next 5–10 years, the industry that manufactures them is expected to grow as much as ten times its current size. The supply chain that feeds the materials into that industry also has to expand at a similar rate. Will it be able to do so? Answering that question is crucial to the future of Li-ion batteries and their ability to solve a host of societal problems, from balancing a renewables-driven electricity grid to electrifying the entire transportation sector.

AB  - Over the past two decades the global mining industry has witnessed the necessity and emergence of community relations and development (CRD) functions, essentially under the rubric of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These functions provide companies with mechanisms through which to engage and manage their relationships with key stakeholder groups, share development benefits and protect business interests. Despite widespread claims by the industry that companies have adopted CSR as a ‘core competence’, we argue that the industry has yet to incorporate the CRD function as part of ‘core business’ at the level of practice. This article characterises a CRD function and related processes within the context of a large-scale mining operation in West Africa. Findings reflect a more universal trend relating to the function and organisational positioning of CRD practice in the resources sector. The authors argue that functional equity needs to be established if the sustainable development agenda is to have a genuine future within the mining industry.

AB  - Material cycles have become increasingly coupled and interconnected in a globalizing era. While material flow analysis (MFA) has been widely used to characterize stocks and flows along technological life cycle within a specific geographical area, trade networks among individual cycles have remained largely unexplored. Here we developed a trade-linked multilevel MFA model to map the contemporary global journey of anthropogenic aluminum. We demonstrate that the anthropogenic aluminum cycle depends substantially on international trade of aluminum in all forms and becomes highly interconnected in nature. While the Southern hemisphere is the main primary resource supplier, aluminum production and consumption concentrate in the Northern hemisphere, where we also find the largest potential for recycling. The more developed countries tend to have a substantial and increasing presence throughout the stages after bauxite refining and possess highly consumption-based cycles, thus maintaining advantages both economically and environmentally. A small group of countries plays a key role in the global redistribution of aluminum and in the connectivity of the network, which may render some countries vulnerable to supply disruption. The model provides potential insights to inform government and industry policies in resource criticality, supply chain security, value chain management, and cross-boundary environmental impacts mitigation.

AB  - This paper surveys the recent literature on the links between public debt and economic growth in advanced economies. We find that theoretical models yield ambiguous results. Whether high levels of public debt have a negative effect on long-run growth is thus an empirical ques-tion. While many papers have found a negative correlation between debt and growth, our reading of the empirical literature is that there is no paper that can make a strong case for a causal relationship going from debt to economic growth. We also find that the presence of thresholds and, more in general, of a non-monotone relationship between debt and growth is not robust to small changes in data coverage and empirical techniques. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges involved in measuring and defining public debt and some sugges-tions for future research which, in our view, should emphasize cross-country heterogeneity.

AB  - Recycled metals have become a significant source of supply, with a lower environmental impact than primary metals. Factors such as geography, trade regulations and economics on domestic recycling and international trade in scrap all influence the extent of recycling. The role of scrap recycling in the USA and its contribution to the Circular Economy with respect to metals is discussed. At one time, almost all the metal scrap arising in the USA was recycled and treated within the country. Since about the early 1980s, there has been a decline in the proportion of scrap metal recycled and treated in-country in the USA in favour, due to apparent cost benefits, of exporting to other countries such as China for treatment. It is considered that subsequently skills and technology in this area will require re-building to enable metal scrap to be efficiently treated at home using the best available technology. With the recent ban by China on certain metal imports, each country will now need to handle more of its own scrap metal. The opportunities in the USA as a consequence of this are discussed in the paper. The paper also describes the results of a case study for copper scrap recycling. As part of this, the technology, energy consumption and GHG emissions are examined in terms of the grade of scrap copperGrade of copper scrapfor selected smelting process routes. It was found that the energy consumption in copper scrap recycling is far lower than that required to produce copper from as-mined ore, while at the same time, it is quite dependent on the grade of actual scrapGrade of copper scraptreated. It is concluded that enhanced copper recycling from secondary materials would be beneficial to the USA, driven by modern technologies as discussed in the paper, as well as encouraging policies from the regulators.

AB  - Climate change mitigation in the materials sector faces a twin challenge: satisfying rapidly rising global demand for materials while significantly curbing greenhouse-gas emissions1, 2. Process efficiency improvement and recycling can contribute to reducing emissions per material output; however, long-term material demand and scrap availability for recycling depend fundamentally on the dynamics of societies’ stocks of products in use3, 4, 5, 6, an issue that has been largely neglected in climate science. Here, we show that aluminium in-use stock patterns set essential boundary conditions for future emission pathways, which has significant implications for mitigation priority setting. If developing countries follow industrialized countries in their aluminium stock patterns, a 50% emission reduction by 2050 below 2000 levels cannot be reached even under very optimistic recycling and technology assumptions. The target can be reached only if future global per-capita aluminium stocks saturate at a level much lower than that in present major industrialized countries. As long as global in-use stocks are growing rapidly, radical new technologies in primary production (for example, inert anode and carbon capture and storage) have the greatest impact in emission reduction; however, their window of opportunity is closing once the stocks begin to saturate and the largest reduction potential shifts to post-consumer scrap recyclin

AB  - This study presents the results of chemical thermodynamic analysis on the distribution of elements in the smelting process of metallic materials to examine the controllability of impurities in the pyrometallurgical technique. The results of the present work can give an answer against the frequently given question; "Which impurity element can be removable in metallurgical process?" or "How far can the impurity level be controlled?". The proposed method was applied to estimate the distribution of 29 elements for a copper converter and 26 elements for a steel-making process and shows the distribution tendency of elements among the gas, slag, and metal phases as well as clarifying which metals can be recovered or removed from secondary resources in metallurgical processes. The effects of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and slag composition on the distribution ratio of elements were also evaluated, and the removal limit or controllability of impurity in these two processes was presented. This study results in thermodynamic features of various elements in the pyrometallurgical process and also shows, even by varying process parameters such as temperature and oxygen partial pressure, no drastic improvement of removal efficiency should be expected, except for lead and tin in copper.

AB  - In previous studies on the physical chemistry of pyrometallurgical processing of aluminum scrap, only a limited number of thermodynamic parameters, such as the Gibbs free energy change of impurity reactions and the variation of activity of an impurity in molten aluminum, were taken into account. In contrast, in this study we thermodynamically evaluated the quantitative removal limit of impurities during the remelting of aluminum scrap; all relevant parameters, such as the total pressure, the activity coefficient of the target impurity, the temperature, the oxygen partial pressure, and the activity coefficient of oxidation product, were considered. For 45 elements that usually occur in aluminum products, the distribution ratios among the metal, slag, and gas phases in the aluminum remelting process were obtained. Our results show that, except for elements such as Mg and Zn, most of the impurities occurred as troublesome tramp elements that are difficult to remove, and our results also indicate that the extent to which the process parameters such as oxygen partial pressure, temperature, and flux composition can be changed in aluminum production is quite limited compared to that for iron and copper production, owing to aluminum's relatively low melting point and strong affinity for oxygen. Therefore, the control of impurities in the disassembly process and the quality of scrap play important roles in suppressing contamination in aluminum recycling.

AB  - This study, encompassing 231 countries and regions, quantifies the global transfer of three critical metals (neodymium, cobalt, and platinum) considered vital for low-carbon technologies by means of material flow analysis (MFA), using trade data (BACI) and the metal contents of trade commodities, resolving the optimization problem to ensure the material balance of the metals within each country and region. The study shows that in 2005 international trade led to global flows of 18.6 kt of neodymium, 154 kt of cobalt, and 402 t of platinum and identifies the main commodities and top 50 bilateral trade links embodying these metals. To explore the issue of consumption efficiency, the flows were characterized according to the technological level of each country or region and divided into three types: green ("efficient use"), yellow ("moderately efficient use"), and red ("inefficient use"). On this basis, the shares of green, yellow, and red flows in the aggregate global flow of Nd were found to be 1.2%, 98%, and 1.2%, respectively. For Co, the respective figures are 53%, 28%, and 19%, and for Pt 15%, 84%, and 0.87%. Furthermore, a simple indicator focusing on the composition of the three colored flows for each commodity was developed to identify trade commodities that should be prioritized for urgent technical improvement to reduce wasteful use of the metals. Based on the indicator, we discuss logical, strategic identification of the responsibilities and roles of the countries involved in the global flows.

AB  - Sustained growth in lithium-ion battery (LIB) demand within the transportation sector (and the electricity sector) motivates detailed investigations of whether future raw materials supply will reconcile with resulting material requirements for these batteries. We track the metal content associated with compounds used in LIBs. We find that most of the key constituents, including manganese, nickel, and natural graphite, have sufficient supply to meet the anticipated increase in demand for LIBs. There may be challenges in rapidly scaling the use of materials associated with lithium and cobalt in the short term. Due to long battery lifetimes and multiple end uses, recycling is unlikely to provide significant short-term supply. There are risks associated with the geopolitical concentrations of these elements, particularly for cobalt. The lessons revealed in this work can be relevant to other industries in which the rapid growth of a materials-dependent technology disrupts the global supply of those materials. The key conclusions of this perspective have shown that the supply of most materials contained within lithium-ion batteries will likely meet the demand for the near future. However, there are potential risks associated with the supply of cobalt. Furthermore, if there is rapid adoption of electric vehicles (incentivized by policy interventions including a carbon tax, higher fuel taxes, and more aggressive Corporate Average Fuel Economy targets), demand could outpace supply for some battery-grade materials (even for lithium in the very near term). The implications for research based on this perspective span many scales. First, continued research into cathode materials that alleviate some of these supply issues is of interest, particularly those that are cobalt free. Supply chain research and investigations in the policy domain may also help uncover ways to address materials availability in the future. Future investigations should provide a dynamic analysis with sufficient detail to map technological and operational changes to their impact on cost and to map performance to market value. There has been continued growth in lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles. This puts new pressure on the supply of materials used in these products. We present an analysis of supply chain issues for lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, and natural graphite focused first on their potential supply concerns and then the scaled demand for these materials. This contribution provides practical considerations that should factor into sustainable energy research, particularly as it relates to global impact on materials supply chains.

AB  - Global annual resource use reached nearly 90 billion metric tons in 2017 and may more than double by 2050. This growth is coupled with a shift of materials extraction from Europe and North America to Asia. In 2017, 60% of all materials were extracted in Asia, and extraction is expected to rise substantially in Africa over the next decade. Local extraction and processing helps to improve standards of living in the developing world, but also leads to important environmental concerns. Globally, materials production and consumption is coming up against environmental constraints in almost every domain, including species biodiversity, land-use change, climate impacts, and biogeochemical flows. Mitigating the impact of materials use is urgent and complex, necessitates proactive assessment of unintended consequences, and requires multidisciplinary systems approaches.

AB  - The increased use of secondary (i.e., recycled) and renewable resources will likely be key toward achieving sustainable materials use. Unfortunately, these strategies share a common barrier to economical implementation - increased quality variation compared to their primary and synthetic counterparts. Current deterministic process-planning models overestimate the economic impact of this increased variation. This paper shows that for a range of industries from biomaterials to inorganics, managing variation through a chance-constrained (CC) model enables increased use of such variable raw materials, or heterogeneous feedstocks (hF), over conventional, deterministic models. An abstract, analytical model and a quantitative model applied to an industrial case of aluminum recycling were used to explore the limits and benefits of the CC formulation. The results indicate that the CC solution can reduce cost and increase potential hF use across a broad range of production conditions through raw materials diversification. These benefits increase where the hFs exhibit mean quality performance close to that of the more homogeneous feedstocks (often the primary and synthetic materials) or have large quality variability. In terms of operational context, the relative performance grows as intolerance for batch error increases and as the opportunity to diversify the raw material portfolio increases.

AB  - Optimizing the charge in secondary steel production is challenging because the chemical composition of the scrap is highly uncertain. The uncertainty can cause a considerable risk of the scrap mix failing to satisfy the composition requirements for the final product. In this paper, we represent the uncertainty based on fuzzy set theory and constrain the failure risk based on a possibility measure. Consequently, the scrap charge optimization problem is modeled as a fuzzy chance constrained linear programming problem. Since the constraints of the model mainly address the specification of the product, the crisp equivalent of the fuzzy constraints should be less relaxed than that purely based on the concept of soft constraints. Based on the application context we adopt a strengthened version of soft constraints to interpret fuzzy constraints and form a crisp model with consistent and compact constraints for solution. Simulation results based on realistic data show that the failure risk can be managed by proper combination of aspiration levels and confidence factors for defining fuzzy numbers. There is a tradeoff between failure risk and material cost. The presented approach applies also for other scrap-based production processes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC Planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems often employ metallic interconnects, which separate and connect individual cells in electrical series to create a stack. Coated and uncoated ferritic stainless steels (FSSs), are reported among the most promising materials currently being investigated for interconnect applications. In this study, FSS AISI 441 samples coated with electroless nickel (∼25 μm) were subjected to intermediate temperature IT-SOFC operating conditions at 700 °C for 500 h with and without the application of electrical current (0.5 Acm−2). The application of the electric current promotes Fe migration on both the cathode and the anode side. This phenomenon results in the formation of a ∼4 μm thick Fe2O3 on the anode side responsible for increased ASR values. Comparative analyses of the current and no current exposures and resultant surface oxide layers, along with suspected mechanisms and implications are presented and discussed.

AB  - The world supply and turnover of copper was modelled using simple empirical estimates and a COPPER systems dynamics model developed for this study. The model combines mining, trade markets, price mechanisms, population dynamics, use in society and waste as well as recycling, into a whole world system. The degree of sustainability and resource time horizon was estimated using four different methods including (1) burn-off rates, (2) peak discovery early warning, (3) Hubbert's production model, and (4) COPPER, a system dynamics model. The ultimately recoverable reserves (URR) have been estimated using different sources that converge around 2800 million tonne, where about 800 million tonne have already been mined, and 2000 million tonne remain. The different methods independently suggest peak copper mine production in the near future. The model was run for a longer period to cover all systems dynamics and delays. The peak production estimates are in a narrow window in time, from 2031 to 2042, with the best model estimate in 2034, or 21 years from the date of writing. In a longer perspective, taking into account price and recycling, the supply of copper to society is estimated to run out sometime after 2400. The outputs from all models put focus on the importance of copper recycling so that society can become more sustainable with respect to copper supply. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present business-as-usual cobalt use in society is not sustainable. Too much cobalt is lost if only market mecha-nisms are expected to improve recycling, and unnecessary cobalt is wasted if no policy actions are taken. Increased recycling and better conservation will be able to improve the supply situation, but this will need active policy par-ticipation beyond what market mechanisms can do alone. To conserve cobalt for coming generations, present policies must be changed within the next few decades. The sooner policies change, the better for future generations.

AB  - Global trends point to a relative decoupling of water – that is, the rate of water resource use is increasing at a rate slower than that of economic growth. The Options for Decoupling Economic Growth from Water Use and Water Pollution report provides an independent assessment of technological and policy-relevant tools and approaches that can be used to achieve the decoupling of water resources from economic development while considering environmental and welfare impacts over the full life cycle. To head off a looming water resource crisis, meet global water demand, and sustain economic growth and human wellbeing, global action for decoupling water from economic growth is essential. The report puts forward a package of policy and practical responses based on decoupling strategies to help the forward looking policy-maker in achieving global aspirations for water sustainability.

AB  - The recycling link between End-of-Life (EoL) product composition and metallurgical recovery is discussed in this chapter with reference to a materials centric view (aluminium, copper) and product centric by referring to products such as End-of-Life Vehicles, WEEE, E-waste, Lighting, TV/Displays and Catalysts, Batteries etc. For each of the EoL metals and products, some detail of "mineralogy," i.e. composition, of each product type is provided also referring to Critical raw materials and recyclate quality. Then recycling in terms of collection and physical as well as metallurgical separation is discussed in some detail. In order to capture the whole cycle, process and system simulation is discussed with reference to various existing tools, also showing various simulation results. Finally, physics-based eco-labeling is discussed while also referring to design for recycling (DfR). 10 Design for Recycling rules are also provided as a function of the detail discussed in this chapter.

AB  - Only around half of U.S. end of life (EOL) aluminum scrap is recycled. We investigate the extent to which the EOL recycling rate is constrained by the ability to collect EOL scrap versus the ability to recycle scrap into new alloys given the compositional mismatch between available scrap and the new alloys demanded by industry. The compositional mismatch means that scrap must be "sweetened" during recycling with virgin metals (primary unalloyed aluminum and alloying elements) to satisfy the chemistry constraints of the new alloys. If the mismatch is too great, then recycling becomes unviable. We first review the reasons for the compositional mismatch by examining its three causes: contamination with tramp elements; mixing of different aluminum scrap during recycling; and shifting demand for new alloys. A linear optimization model is then used to analyze the current and potential domestic U.S. recycling rate at different levels of collection from end use scrap categories such as buildings. The model determines the minimum quantity of virgin metal needed to satisfy new alloy demand if different metal sources (including scrap and virgin metal) can be combined to make the new alloys just like they are in the recycling industry. Optimization constraints include not exceeding the use of available scrap, satisfying demand for new alloys, meeting the chemical composition limits of the new alloys, and an economic furnace constraint that limits the weight fraction of virgin metals used in a recycling furnace. The results show that even if all EOL aluminum scrap could be collected in the U.S. then, because of the compositional mismatch between scrap and new alloys, only around 70% could be recycled domestically.

AB  - The so&#8208;called circular economy&#8212;the concept of closing material loops to preserve products, parts, and materials in the industrial system and extract their maximum utility&#8212;has recently started gaining momentum. The idea of substituting lower&#8208;impact secondary production for environmentally intensive primary production gives the circular economy a strong intuitive environmental appeal. However, proponents of the circular economy have tended to look at the world purely as an engineering system and have overlooked the economic part of the circular economy. Recent research has started to question the core of the circular economy&#8212;namely, whether closing material and product loops does, in fact, prevent primary production. In this article, we argue that circular economy activities can increase overall production, which can partially or fully offset their benefits. Because there is a strong parallel in this respect to energy efficiency rebound, we have termed this effect &#8220;circular economy rebound.&#8221; Circular economy rebound occurs when circular economy activities, which have lower per&#8208;unit&#8208;production impacts, also cause increased levels of production, reducing their benefit. We describe the mechanisms that cause circular economy rebound, which include the limited ability of secondary products to substitute for primary products, and price effects. We then offer some potential strategies for avoiding circular economy rebound. However, these strategies are unlikely to be attractive to for&#8208;profit firms, so we caution that simply encouraging private firms to find profitable opportunities in the circular economy is likely to cause rebound and lower or eliminate the potential environmental benefits.

AB  - The most significant environmental benefit of recycling or reusing a wide range of products and materials is typically the potential to displace primary material production; lack of displacement significantly reduces the environmental benefits of these activities. Because no consensus method to estimate displacement rate has emerged, environmental assessments have tended to assume that displacement occurs on a one‐to‐one basis. However, displaced production is a complex phenomenon governed primarily by market mechanisms, rather than physical relationships. This article advances the understanding of displacement by presenting a market‐based framework describing the displacement relationship and a methodology for quantifying displacement rate based on partial equilibrium modeling. Using this methodology, a general symbolic equation for displacement rate after an increase in recycling is derived. The model highlights the market mechanisms that govern displaced production and identifies five price response parameters that affect displacement rate. Results suggest that one‐to‐one displacement occurs only under specific parameter restrictions that are unlikely in competitive commodity markets, but zero displacement is possible if secondary materials are poor substitutes for primary materials; displacement is likely to be reduced if secondary materials have inferior technical properties. The presented methodology can be generally applied to any system in which recycled or reused materials are substitutes or complements for primary materials. Implications for improving recycling and reuse efficacy and environmental assessment methodology are discussed, and suggestions are presented for expanding the displacement methodology in future research.

AB  - Recycling materials from end&#8208;of&#8208;life products has the potential to create environmental benefit by displacing more harmful primary material production. However, displacement is governed by market forces and is not guaranteed; if full displacement does not occur, the environmental benefits of recycling are reduced or eliminated. Therefore, quantifying the true &#8220;displacement rate&#8221; caused by recycling is essential to accurately assess environmental benefits and make optimal environmental management decisions. Our 2016 article proposed a market&#8208;based methodology to estimate actual displacement rates following an increase in recycling or reuse. The current article demonstrates the operation, utility, and challenges of that methodology in the context of the U.S. aluminum industry. Sensitivity analyses reveal that displacement estimates are sensitive to uncertainty in price elasticities. Results suggest that 100% displacement is unlikely immediately following a sustained supply&#8208;driven increase in aluminum recycling and even less likely in the long term. However, zero and even negative displacement are possible. A variant of the model revealed that demand&#8208;driven increases in recycling are less likely than supply&#8208;driven changes to result in full displacement. However, model limitations exist and challenges arose in the estimation process, the effects of which are discussed. We suggest implications for environmental assessment, present lessons learned from applying the estimation methodology, and highlight the need for further research in the market dynamics of recycling.
